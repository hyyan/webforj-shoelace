Scaffold a webforJ Spring Boot project in this folder using the webforJ MCP server create-project tool (sidemenu archetype, Spring Boot flavor). Group ID: com.webforj.shoelace, artifact ID: webforj-shoelace.

Then port every Shoelace web component (https://shoelace.style) into webforJ. Every component, every feature, no exceptions.

This is a Java-first port. Design every API the way a Java developer expects to use it — not a thin wrapper over JS. Each component gets its own sub-package under com.webforj.shoelace.

Create a demo view for each component category showing all features working together. Wire them into the sidemenu navigation.

Write tests for every component. Tests are not optional.

Do not stop. Do not ask for confirmation between components. Work through every component one by one until the full Shoelace library is ported.
